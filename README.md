# Network Monitor Tool

This is a Network Monitor Tool that pings a specified host at regular intervals and executes a predefined command if the host becomes unreachable for a given number of consecutive failures.

## Features

- **Customizable Ping Interval**: Specify the interval between pings in milliseconds.
- **Max Failure Threshold**: Set the maximum number of consecutive ping failures before triggering the command.
- **Ping Timeout**: Configure the time to wait for a ping response.
- **Unprivileged Mode**: Option to run ping in unprivileged mode.
- **Cooldown Period**: Define a cooldown period after the command is executed before starting to ping again.
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logging with timestamps, errors, and information messages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Build the application**:
    ```sh
    go build -o network-monitor
    ```

## Usage

Run the executable with the required parameters:

```sh
./network-monitor [OPTIONS] COMMAND...
```


### Options

- `--interval`: Interval in milliseconds between pings (default: 3000 ms).
- `--max-failures`: Maximum number of consecutive ping failures before running the command (default: 5).
- `--host`: Hostname to ping (IP address recommended, default: `1.1.1.1`).
- `--timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds for each ping (default: 1000 ms).
- `--unprivileged`: Run ping in unprivileged mode.
- `--cooldown`: Cooldown period in milliseconds after running the command before pinging again (default: 300000 ms).

### Positional Arguments

- `COMMAND`: The command to execute if the max failures threshold is reached. Pass the command and its arguments as positional arguments.

### Example

To ping `8.8.8.8` every 3 seconds and run `echo 'Host unreachable'` if it fails to ping successfully 5 consecutive times:

```sh
./network-monitor --host 8.8.8.8 --interval 3000 --max-failures 5 --timeout 1000 --cooldown 60000 echo Host unreachable
```

## Logging

Logs are printed to the console with timestamps and include information on:

- Successful pings
- Ping failures
- Command execution status and output
